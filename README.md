# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a basic HTML project created as part of the Odin Project's Web Development curriculum. It is designed to demonstrate foundational skills in HTML structure, navigation, and content organization.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Creating a homepage (`index.html`) with links to individual recipe pages.
- Building separate HTML pages for each recipe, including:
  - A title
  - An image of the dish
  - A description of the recipe
  - A list of ingredients
  - Step-by-step instructions
- Structuring navigation links for seamless user experience.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing semantic HTML.
- Structuring files and directories in a project.
- Implementing internal navigation using relative links.
- Creating organized and visually appealing layouts.

<!-- ## Future Goals
As this project progresses, I plan to:
- Enhance the design with CSS for improved aesthetics.
- Add JavaScript functionality for interactivity.
- Explore other features like responsive design and accessibility.

Stay tuned for updates! -->
