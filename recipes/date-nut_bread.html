    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the recipe for date-nut bread that my grandmother always made around Christmas time. Definitely a family favorite! For best results, don't use a glass pan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups boiling water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pitted dates</li>
        <li>7 pitted prunes, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 egg, well-beaten</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put raisins in a bowl. Pour boiling water over raisins; soak until raisins have flavored water, about 20 minutes. Drain raisins, reserving water. Discard raisins.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with butter.</li>
        <li>Bring reserved water to a boil in a small saucepan. Measure 3/4 cup boiling water into a bowl. Stir baking soda into water.</li>
        <li>Put dates and prunes in a large bowl. Pour baking soda-water over dates and prunes; add unsalted butter and stir until melted. Stir sugar and vanilla extract into fruit mixture; let cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Stir egg into fruit mixture to evenly coat. Mix flour and salt together in a small bowl; add to fruit mixture and stir. Fold walnuts into mixture and pour into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
